## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-07

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Automatic Arrow Function Transformation**: Added GAS compatibility for arrow functions
  - Arrow functions are now automatically converted to function declarations
  - Uses esbuild's ES5 target for reliable transformation
  - No additional configuration required - works out of the box
  - Ensures compatibility with Google Apps Script runtime restrictions

### üîß Technical Improvements

### üìù Code Examples
```javascript
// Before (TypeScript with arrow functions)
const processData = (data) => {
  return data.map(item => item * 2);
};

// After (GAS-compatible JavaScript)
function processData(data) {
  return data.map(function(item) {
    return item * 2;
  });
}
```
